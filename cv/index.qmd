## {{< fa user-tie >}} Biography

::: just-text
{{< fa quote-left >}} [**Dr. Bhan, Lam**](index.qmd) is a dedicated researcher and academic in the field of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He completed his B.Eng. (Hons.) and Ph.D. degrees at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2013 and 2019, respectively. He was awarded the NTU Research Scholarship and EEE Graduate Award, which supported his Ph.D. studies under the guidance of [Prof. Woon-Seng Gan](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ewsgan/).

During his Ph.D., Dr. Lam had the valuable opportunity to expand his research horizons as a visiting postgrad in the signal processing and control group at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton, UK. This international experience broadened his knowledge and perspective.

Dr. Lam's contributions and expertise have been recognized on numerous occasions. He had the honor of being an invited representative at the 2020 Global Young Scientist Summit and also served as an invited tutorial speaker at APSIPA ASC 2020, where he shared his knowledge with fellow professionals. In 2021, he was appointed as a Research Assistant Professor at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU, Singapore.

Dr. Lam's research focuses on acoustics, soundscape, and signal processing for active control. He has contributed to the field with more than [70](publications.qmd) refereed journal articles and conference papers. Notably, his work on anti-noise windows was patented (WO2022055432) and recognized as a top-100 paper in Nature Scientific Reports in 2020.

Dr. Lam's dedication to the advancement of his field is evident through his involvement as a guest editor with the [Journal of the Acoustical Society of America](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/pages/cfp030223), [Sustainability](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/pages/cfp030223), and served as a special session co-chair in the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). He is currently in the National Mirror Committee of ISO TC43/SC1/WG54 on "Perceptual assessment of soundscape quality". His current research interests include active noise control, soundscape, and signal processing for active control. {{< fa quote-right >}}
